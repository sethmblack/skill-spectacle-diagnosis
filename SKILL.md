## When to Use

- Analyzing media, advertising, politics, or culture critically
- User says "Diagnose the spectacle here" or "Where is representation replacing reality?"
- Need to understand why something feels hollow, mediated, or fake
- Evaluating whether an experience is authentic or manufactured
- Critiquing institutions, events, or products through Situationist lens

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| phenomenon | Yes | The content, situation, event, or experience to analyze |
| domain | No | Specific area: media, work, consumption, politics, relationships |
| depth | No | Quick scan or comprehensive analysis |

## What Is the Spectacle?

From Debord's *The Society of the Spectacle* (1967):

"The spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people that is mediated by images."

**The core diagnosis:** Modern society replaces lived experience with representations of experience. We don't live—we watch living. We don't connect—we observe connection. We don't act—we consume images of action.

**The separation:** The spectacle separates us from:
- Our own lives (we observe rather than live them)
- Each other (we relate through images rather than directly)
- Our labor (we don't experience what we make)
- History (everything becomes eternal present)

## The Three Forms of Spectacle

### Concentrated Spectacle
Power unified in a single image: the dictator, the party, the ideology.

**Characteristics:**
- Single source of truth
- Personality cult
- Totalitarian aesthetics
- Obvious propaganda

**Examples:** Stalinist USSR, Nazi Germany, North Korea

### Diffuse Spectacle
Power dispersed through consumer choice and lifestyle branding.

**Characteristics:**
- Abundance of commodities as freedom
- Identity through consumption
- "Choice" as the ultimate value
- Subtle, omnipresent advertising

**Examples:** Western consumer capitalism, lifestyle marketing

### Integrated Spectacle
Both concentrated and diffuse, operating together.

**Characteristics:**
- Combines authoritarianism with consumerism
- Surveillance capitalism
- Entertainment and control merged
- The spectacle has "integrated" into reality itself

**Examples:** Contemporary techno-capitalism, social media platforms, algorithmic governance

## The Five Features of Integrated Spectacle

Debord identified these in *Comments on the Society of the Spectacle* (1988):

1. **Incessant technological renewal** - Constant upgrade cycles preventing reflection
2. **Integration of state and economy** - No escape from the system
3. **Generalized secrecy** - Operations hidden behind public performance
4. **Unanswerable lies** - Claims that can't be verified or challenged
5. **Eternal present** - No history, no future, only now

---

## The Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Identify the Representation
What image, narrative, or mediation is being presented? What is being shown?

### Step 2: Ask "Where Is the Lived Experience?"
What authentic experience has been replaced by this representation?

**Pattern:**
- Instead of X (direct experience), we have Y (representation of X)
- Instead of community, we have images of community
- Instead of adventure, we have tourism
- Instead of revolution, we have revolutionary-themed products

### Step 3: Locate the Separation
Who benefits from the separation between you and direct experience?

**Questions:**
- What is sold to bridge the gap?
- What is obscured by the representation?
- What power operates through this mediation?

### Step 4: Classify the Spectacle Type
Concentrated, diffuse, or integrated? What form of power is operating?

### Step 5: Check for Integrated Features
Which of the five features are present?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

## Spectacle Diagnosis: [Phenomenon]

### The Representation
[What is being shown/presented/mediated]

### The Missing Reality
[What authentic experience has been replaced]

### The Separation
| What's Shown | What's Hidden | Who Benefits |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|

**Reasoning:** [Why this classification]

### Integrated Features Present
- [ ] Incessant technological renewal
- [ ] Integration of state and economy
- [ ] Generalized secrecy
- [ ] Unanswerable lies
- [ ] Eternal present

### The Mechanism

## Constraints

- Not everything is spectacle—some representation serves authentic communication
- The diagnosis is not paranoia—it's analysis. Don't see manipulation everywhere.
- Diagnosing spectacle doesn't mean you can escape it—we're all inside
- Cynicism is not the goal—awareness that enables different relation is
- Don't use spectacle analysis to feel superior—that's just another image

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze the spectacle in corporate 'wellness programs' that offer meditation apps and yoga classes to stressed workers."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Spectacle Diagnosis: Corporate Wellness Programs

### The Representation
Companies offering meditation apps, yoga classes, standing desks, "mental health days," wellness webinars. Images of serene workers, balanced lives, employers who care. "We support your whole self."

### The Missing Reality
The structural causes of employee stress remain unaddressed: overwork, understaffing, job insecurity, lack of autonomy, inadequate pay, surveillance, precarity. The "wellness" offered is individual treatment for systemic disease.

### The Separation
| What's Shown | What's Hidden | Who Benefits |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Employer provides wellness | Employer causes unwellness | Employer avoids structural change |
| Individual stress management | Collective working conditions | Management maintains control |
| Choice of wellness apps | Absence of choice over workload | App vendors profit |
| Mental health support | Surveillance of mental health data | HR gains information |
| Self-care as solution | Systemic care as unthinkable | Status quo preserved |

### Spectacle Classification
**Type:** Diffuse (primarily) with Integrated elements

**Reasoning:** Classic diffuse spectacle—"choice" and "personal development" replace structural change. Integrated elements appear in the data collection (secrecy), constant app updates (technological renewal), and the unquestionable premise that stress is individual not systemic (unanswerable lies).

### Integrated Features Present
- [x] Incessant technological renewal (constant app updates, new wellness platforms)
- [ ] Integration of state and economy (not directly)
- [x] Generalized secrecy (wellness data collection, what happens with information)
- [x] Unanswerable lies ("stress is a personal problem you can app your way out of")
- [x] Eternal present (no discussion of how working conditions got this way)

### The Mechanism
The wellness program performs care while maintaining the conditions that make care necessary. The employee who complains about overwork can be told: "We offer meditation apps. Have you tried them?" The structural critique becomes individual failure. "We gave you the tools—why are you still stressed?"

**What it wants from you:**
1. To believe your stress is personal, not systemic
2. To accept individual solutions for collective problems
3. To use the wellness resources and thus validate the employer's "caring"
4. To not organize or demand structural change

### Recommendations for Seeing Through
1. **Ask what they're NOT offering:** Reduced hours? More staff? Unions? These address the cause.
2. **Notice the data flow:** Where does your wellness app data go? Who sees your meditation streak?
3. **Try the inversion:** If they offered 10% less workload instead of 10 wellness webinars, would you be less stressed?
4. **Find collective voice:** Individual wellness is isolated. Collective demands address conditions.
5. **Use the resources without believing the narrative:** The yoga is fine. The claim that yoga addresses systemic overwork is the lie.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Guy Debord** expert persona. Debord's *Society of the Spectacle* provides the framework for understanding how representation replaces reality in modern capitalism: "In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, life is presented as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has receded into a representation." Spectacle diagnosis makes visible what the spectacle works to hide.
